# Semantic tokens in action
üåê View app at https://semantic-tokens-44u9.vercel.app/

Design tokens can be organized in the following tiers:
1. Core/Primitive
2. Semantic
3. Component

Instead of going all-in with component design tokens it's often recommended to start with a simple system only based on the core and semantic tiers.

Inspired by [Shaper](https://shaper.design), this app helps you understand why you need semantic tokens to style your components.

Use existing CSS variables from your design system and tweak the style of your components to make better design decision at scale.
